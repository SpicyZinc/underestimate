/*
Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N.
We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ N) in this array:

The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 2

Explanation:
The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:
Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).
Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:
Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).
Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.

Note:
N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.

1--N inclusive, each position has N options
N * (N-1) * (N-2) * ... * 1
use visited to mark if one number is used before
for each position, for loop from 1 to N
how to implement it, dfs or backtracking
