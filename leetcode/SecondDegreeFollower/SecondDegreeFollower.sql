/*In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.
Please write a sql query to get the amount of each follower’s follower if he/she has one.

For example:
+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+
should output:
+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+
Explaination:
Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B's follower is C and D, and D's follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.

Note:
Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.
Please display the result in follower's alphabet order.

idea:
join 首先是横向
再次是 common intersection

*/

select a.follower, count(distinct b.follower) as num from follow a
join follow b
on a.follower = b.followee
group by b.followee
