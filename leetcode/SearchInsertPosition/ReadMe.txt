SearchInsertPosition.java
contains two methods:
1. insert before target if there is a target in array, no duplicates in array
2. insert after target if there is a target in array, also duplicates are allowed

FindInsertPosition.java
recursive version 
insert after target if there is a target in array, also duplicates are allowed
